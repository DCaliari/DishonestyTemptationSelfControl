Title of the project: "Dishonesty: the role of planning, temptation, and self-control."

The project contains the code to replicate tables, figures, and results for the paper: "Dishonesty: the role of planning, temptation, and self-control". There are two coding languages: (i) MATLAB is used to create figures, analysis, and datasets, (ii) Stata is used solely for the regression analysis (Table 4) and descriptive statistics (Table 3).

The replication software and supporting data are organized in the following directories: (i) Experiment data: the folder contains the data sources. (ii) Analysis.m: the Matlab file replicates all figures. Further, it contains the code that creates the dataset employed in the Stata code ["TempSelfControl.csv"]. (iii) code_Tables_3and4.do: the Stata file replicates tables 3 and 4.

The folder "Functions" contains MATLAB functions that are needed for statistical tests, data loading, and variable creation.

The folder "Ztree_code" contains the ztree code of the experiment.

The files 48QB6.pdf and 48QB6-Scoring-Psychometrics.pdf contain details about the personality traits questionnaire and the resulting variables.
